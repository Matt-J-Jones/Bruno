### Automated Anxiety

Anthropomorphism is the act of attributing human characteristics to non-human objects or items.
This project aims to explore this concept and if a non-human item can be seen to "feel" a human
emotion, from the point of view of human observers.

“Bruno” is a non-human device that suffers from social anxiety. When left alone he is calm, but if
someone approaches him, he gets stressed and panics until he is alone again.
